Spotify API Integration Plan for Spotify 2.0 Clone Music App

1. Authentication Setup
- Register app on Spotify Developer Dashboard to get client ID and client secret.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow for user login and access token retrieval.
- Store access token securely and handle token refresh.

2. API Utility Functions
- Create a new module (e.g., src/api/spotify.js) to handle API requests.
- Implement functions to:
  - Search tracks, albums, playlists by query.
  - Get user's playlists.
  - Get album details and tracks.
  - Control playback (play, pause, next, previous).
- Use fetch or axios with Authorization header including access token.

3. Context Updates
- Update PlayerContext to use Spotify API for playback control and track info.
- Create a new SpotifyContext or extend PlaylistContext to manage Spotify playlists and data.

4. Component Updates
- Update Search component to fetch search results from Spotify API.
- Update DisplayHome, DisplayAlbum, Sidebar, and Player components to use API data.
- Handle loading and error states gracefully.

5. Additional Considerations
- Implement user login/logout UI.
- Handle API rate limits and errors.
- Ensure smooth UX with loading indicators and fallback UI.

Next Steps:
- Confirm this plan with the user.
- Proceed with setting up authentication and API utilities.
- Incrementally update context and components to use Spotify API data.

Please confirm if you want me to proceed with this Spotify API integration plan or suggest any modifications.
